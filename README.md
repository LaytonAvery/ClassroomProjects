# ClassroomProjects
A collection of in-class projects.
This repository features a mobile responsive ToDo List App that was built with the goal of producing 
an interactive user interface while dynamically creating HTML elements using JavaScript. Items appear gray when hovered over.

I also created a mobile responsive restaurant menu that can be filtered by course.
